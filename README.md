# Subscription-Tracker
To run the website, iterate through the SubTrack file, and into the bin folder. Run the .bat file to run the server with embedded H2 database.
At the bottom of the console, there will be a localhost link to the website. Copy and paste the link to any web browser, most preferably Chrome, and you can view the website.
